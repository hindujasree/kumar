Dogs often have jobs, including as police dogs, army dogs, 
assistance dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs,
 herding dogs, or rescue dogs. They are sometimes called "canines" 
from the Latin word for dog - canis. Sometimes people also use
 "dog" to describe other canids, such as wolves.

powerful clues for the ingredients of a healthy, happy, balanced life 
for your pet. Dogs live in many habitats, including prairies, 
deserts, grasslands, forests, rain forests, coastal regions and arctic
 zones.
